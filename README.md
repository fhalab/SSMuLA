## About

Code base for Site Saturation Mutagenesis Landscape Analysis

### Datasets
* The `data` folder is structured based on the landscape name, for each:
    - `fasta`: the fasta file for the parent
    - `fitness_landscape`: the csv file for the mutants and fitness values
    - `processed`: processed fitness file

#### Three systems
##### DHFR
    * A dihydrofolate reductasae (DHFR) encoded by *E. coli folA* gene [Papkou *et al.*, Science (2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh3860)
    * 9 mucleotides at 3 amino aicd positions (A26, D27, L28)
    * Almost 4^9 (262,144) DNA genotypes
    * Map fitness to trimethoprim resistance
    * Sixfold replicates
     * PDB ID: 6XG5
##### TrpB
    * A thermostable Î²-subunit of tryptophan synthase [Johnston *et al.*, PNAS (2024)]
    * Synthesizes L-tryptophan from indol and L-serine
    * Select for ability to complement Trp auxotrophy supplied with exogenous indole
    * Connects TrpB activity to growth rate
    * Hyperthermophile *Thermotoga maritima*, Tm9D8* was selected as the parent enzyme
    * 4-site-saturation landscape (V183, F184, V227, S228)
    * Fitness calcualted from multiple timepoints and aggregared into a final fitness score per vairant
    * Two replicates
    * PDB ID: 8VHH
    * Define active as 1.96 standard deviations above the mean fitness of all stop-codon-containing sequences over both replicates
    * LibA
    * LibB
    * LibC
    * LibD
    * LibE
    * LibF
    * LibG
    * LibH
    * Four-site
##### GB1

## Prepare for installation

If you don't already have twine installed run the following:
`python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine`

## The following will create the package
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine check dist/SSMuLA-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

## Install to python environment localling

`pip install PATH_TO_SSMuLA/dist/SSMuLA-1.0.0.tar.gz`
You should run this before uploading it and check all works as expected.

## The following will push the package to pip 
**Note you need to set up a pip account first**

```
twine upload dist/*
```

## Have a look at your projects page on pip

`https://pypi.org/project/SSMuLA/`
